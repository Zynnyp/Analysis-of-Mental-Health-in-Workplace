### **Model**: Logistic regression predicting *"seeks_treatment"*

***Report***

> Coefficients and p-values were examined for each predictor.
>
> A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the predictor has a statistically significant effect on the odds of seeking treatment.


**Result Interpretation**: ***ALL Predictors***

> The results for ALL predictors show that they were not statistical significance predictors for "seeking treatment" (P>0.05). In other words, increase or decrease in the anaylysed predictor variables does not affect the odds of seeking treatment.

## General Insight

> The model proved that the anaylsed predictor variables (stress_level
sleep_hours, physical_activity_day, depression_score, anxiety_score, social_support_score, and productivity_score) were insignificant predictors of the likelihood of employees to seek treatment for their mental health troubless.
>
> However, although the predictor variables are insignificant, they may still play a role in a multivariate context or interact with others, which could be tested in more advanced models.

# **Simple Linear Regression**

> This model is built to investigate the social and lifestyle determinants of mental health among employees in the workplace.

### **Model**: OLS - Simple linear regression

**Target Variables**: *depression_score, anxiety_score, and productivity_score*

**Predictor Variables**: *sleep_hours, physical_activity_days, social_support_score*

> Result showed no statistical significant correlation between the predictor and target variables

### **Interpretation**

> The model established that sleep hours, physical activity and having social support were insignificant predictors of mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and productivity.

## General Insight

> These results suggest that lifestyle factors like sleep and physical activity, and social factors like support, cannot determine or explain variations in mental health status among employees in the work places.

# **Simple Linear Regression Predicting Productivity Score**

> From previously noted significant correlation between depression_score vs productivity_score, we built this model to determine causation

> R-squared = 0.882

> There is a significant association between Depression_score and Productivity_score.


### **Interpretation**

> A significant negative β coefficient for depression_score predicting productivity_score (β = -1.4688, p = 0.000, R² = 0.882) suggests that as depression increases, productivity decreases. Hence indicating a strong linear relationship.

## General Insight

> The result suggest that depression can explain variations in productivity among employees in the work place.
